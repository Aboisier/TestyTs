TestyTs is a modern TypeScript testing framework.

## Why?
Writing tests should be fun. The other testing framework solutions do not make use of the full power of TypeScript. This one uses decorators and OOP and stuff. Therefore, it makes writing tests fun.

## Installation

```
$ npm install --save-dev testyts
$ npm install -g testyts
```

## Setup

To generate a testy.json configuration file, use the following cmmand:

```
$ testyts init
```


## Write some tests

### The basics 
Writing tests with Testy is simple. Don't forget to export your test suites though. Otherwise, they won't be discovered by the test runner.

```ts
@testSuite()
export class MyTestSuite {

    @test()
    onePlusOne() {
        // Act
        const result = 1 + 1;
        
        // Assert
        expect.toBeEqual(result, 2);
    }
}
```

### Setup and teardown

Testy provides setup and teardown hooks.

```ts
@testSuite()
export class MyTestSuite {

    @beforeAll()
    beforeAll() {
        // This is executed before all the tests
    }

    @beforeEach()
    beforeEach() {
        // This is executed before each test
    }

    @afterEach()
    afterEach() {
        // This is executed after each test
    }
    
    @afterAll()
    afterAll() {
        // This is executed after all the tests
    }
}
```

### Reuse code!

This is where stuff gets interesting. Testy allows you to use base test classes. The base test can have setup and teardown methods. Your child test suite may also have setup and teardown methods. In that case, the base test methods are executed first.

```ts
class MyBaseTestSuite{
    // Setup/teardown extravaganza
}

@testSuite()
class MyTestSuite extends MyBaseTestSuite {
    // My tests
}
```

### Test cases

```ts
@testSuite()
export class MyTestSuite {
    @test('Addition', [
          new TestCase('Two plus two is four', 2, 2, 4),
          new TestCase(`Minus one that's three`, 4, -1, 3)
    ])
    onePlusOne(a: number, b: number, result: number) {
        expect.toBeEqual(a + b, result);
    }
}
```

### Asserting

There's a whole bunch of assertion methods and also a dash of syntactic sugar sexyness in the expect class.

```ts
expect.toBeTrue(2 > 1);
expect.toBeEqual('a', 'a');
expect.not.toBeEqual('p', 'np');
expect.toThrow(() => someNastyMethod());
expect.toBeSorted.inAscendingOrder([0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8]);
// More!
```

### Ignoring or focusing some tests

You can ignore tests by adding an `x` before a test suite or a specific test decorator. Ignored tests will still show up in the test report, but they will be marked as ignored.

```ts
@xtestSuite() // This test suite will be ignored
export class MyTestSuite { 
// Your tests
}

@testSuite()
export class MyTestSuite {
    @xtest() // This test will be ignored
    onePlusOne() {
       // Some test
    }
}
```

You can also focus tests by adding an `f` before a test suite or a specific test decorator. If one test or test suites are focused, only those will be runned. The others will be reported as ignored.

```ts
@ftestSuite() // This test suite will be focused.
export class MyTestSuite { 
...
}

@testSuite()
export class MyTestSuite {
    @ftest() // This test will be focused
    onePlusOne() {
       // Your test
    }
}
```

## Custom tests and test suites names 

The tests and test suites names are inferred from the method or class name by default. You can specify a custom name.

```ts
@testSuite('My glorious test suite')
export class MyTestSuite {

    @test('Adding one plus one, should equal two')
    onePlusOne() {
        // Act
        const result = 1 + 1;
        
        // Assert
        expect.toBeEqual(result, 2);
    }
}
```

## Run the tests

To run the tests, use the following command

```
$ testyts
$ testyts --config custom/config/file.json // To specify a custom configuration file
```
