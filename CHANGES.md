# Changes

## 2.0.0-beta.4

### Improvements

- Add a new cli option (`-files <comma-separated-list-of-glob>`) to allow users to run tests located in files matching any of the specified glob patterns. _(Thanks for the suggestion, Mladen!)_

## 2.0.0-beta.3

### Fixes

- Fixed issue with the `XTestSuite`. It did not ignore tests, now it does.

### Improvements

- Added a new way of focusing/ignoring tests. Instead of focusing tests using the `@FTest()` decorator, it is now possible to simply use the `@Test.focus()` method. Symetrically, it is possible to ignore tests by doing `@Test.ignore()`. This also works for test suites.

## 2.0.0-beta.2

### Improvements

- Improved logging (failed test suites now display the stacktrace, more color and bold were added) _(#79, thanks for the suggestion, #geon!)_

## 2.0.0-beta.1

_Deployed by mistake_ ðŸ‘€

## 1.1.2

## 1.0.2

### Misc.

- Reduced package size by 30% by removing unnecessary files

## 1.0.1

### Misc.

- Changed the version number to 1.0.1 because it seems like the library was initially published with the version number 1.0.0, so this version number can't be reused. RIP
